/*
    Functions:
        -> Function statement aka Function declaration aka Named function
        -> Function expression
        -> Anonymous function
        -> Named function expression
        -> First-class functions(First-class citizens)
        -> Higher-order function
        -> callback functions
        -> Arrow function
        -> Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
        -> Pure and Impure functions
        -> Constructor function

    Parameters and Arguments: 
        -> Parameters are variables that are listed as part of the funciton definition. They are
            the placeholeders for the values that function uses when executed.
        -> Arguments are the actual values that are passed to the function when invoked.

    Diff b't "Function statement" & "Function expression":
        -> Funtion statements(Function declaration) are hoisted and can be called before declaration
            where as Function expressions are not hoisted since they are assigned to variables 
            as a value and cannot be called before the line where the function is defined.

    Anonymous function: A function that doesn't have a name.
        -> These are created by function expressions or arrow functions.
        -> These are passed as arguments to another functions.
        -> These are mostly used:
            -> As callbacks to pass arguments to another functions like seTimeout(), 
               for handling events like clicks etc.
            -> In IIFEs as functions etc.

    Named function expression: A function expression that has a name even though it is assigned to a variable.
        -> In this, named function is invoked only from inside the function and the named function
            cannot be called outside the function.
        -> It can be used for recursion where the function needs refrence to itself.
        -> It is used for better debugging, since named functions gives more meaningful information
            than anonymous functions in debugging tools or stack traces.

    First-class functions: (First-class citizens)
        -> Functions are treated like any other values or objects in JS, that means functions can be 
            assigned to variables, passed as arguments to another functions, can be returned from functions,
            can be stores in data structures like arrays, objects etc.

    Higher-order function:
        -> If a function takes one or more another functions as arguments or 
            returns a function as result, then it is called Higher-order function.

    callback functions:
        -> Callback is a function which is passed as an argument to another function 
            and it is executed after specific point of time or an event has occurred.
        -> Callbacks are essential for handling tasks like fetching data from server,
            timers etc. without blocking the execution of other code and they provide 
            a way to handle async operations.
        -> Callbacks are heavily used to handle events.
        For Ex: When you clcik a button, you define a calback function to handle 
        that event.

    Arrow function:
        -> Arrow functions are more concise way to write functions in JavaScript. 
            They provide shorter syntax and they are introduced in ES6.
        -> Arrow functions doesn't have their own "this" binding, they inherit "this"
            from the surrounding scope  where the function is defined.
        -> They don't have a name, but when assigned to a variable or an object property
            they inherit a name based on the variable or property name.

    Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):
        -> An IIFE is a function expression that gets executed immediately after created
            without calling it explicitly.
        -> The paranthesis around it makes it an expression not a declaration.

    Pure and Impure functions:
        -> Pure function is that, if given the same inputs, will always return the same output
            with causing any side affects(doesn't alter any external state or data).
        -> Impure function is that which produces different output even with same inputs or
            may cause side effects by modifying external state or data.

        -> It's better to write pure functions most of the times because they are more predictable,
            testable and maintainable.

    Constructor function:
        -> Constructor function is a special type of function used to create and initialize objects.
        -> When called with "new" keyword, it creates instance of an object with properties and 
            methods defined inside the function.
        -> It is conventionally written in a capitalized name to distinguish it from regular functions.

  Key Differences:
  ----------------
  
  Feature	                     | First-Class Functions	      Higher-Order Functions
  -------                        ---------------------        ----------------------
  Definition	                 | Functions treated as values	Functions that take/return other functions
  Can be assigned to a variable| ✅	                        ✅
  Can be passed as arguments	 | ✅	                        ✅
  Can return another function	 | ❌ (Not necessarily)	      ✅
  Example	                     | const fn = () => {}	        arr.map(fn) or function returning function
  
  Summary:
  --------
  -> First-class functions mean functions are treated like any other value.
  -> Higher-order functions operate on functions by taking them as arguments or returning them.
  -> JavaScript supports both concepts, making it highly functional and expressive.
